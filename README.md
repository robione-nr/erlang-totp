# Erlang - TOTP Validator

Erlang implementation of RFC 6238 TOTP. Also made compatible with Google Authenticator. Initially dropped in from my private project.

Will update to be more flexible allowing users to establish new connections, customize timesteps, pin digits, etc. Currently compatible with GA with hard-coded key.
